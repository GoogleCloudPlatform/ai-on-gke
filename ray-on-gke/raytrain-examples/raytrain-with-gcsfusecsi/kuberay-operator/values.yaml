# Environment variables
env:
# If not set or set to true, kuberay auto injects an init container waiting for ray GCS.
# If false, you will need to inject your own init container to ensure ray GCS is up before the ray workers start.
# NOTE: This has been explicitly the init container mounts all volumes from the ray spec. This would fail because GCS Fuse based volume mounts are not supported with init containers (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcs-fuse-csi-driver/issues/38). Improvements will de done to GCS CSI as part of k8s sidecar feature (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/116429).
