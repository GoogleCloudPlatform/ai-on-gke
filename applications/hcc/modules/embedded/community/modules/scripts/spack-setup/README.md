## Description

This module can be used to setup and install Spack on a VM. To actually run
Spack commands to install other software use the
[spack-execute](../spack-execute/) module.

This module generates a script that performs the following:

1. Install system dependencies needed for Spack
1. Clone Spack into a predefined directory
1. Check out a specific version of Spack

There are several options on how to consume the outputs of this module:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Breaking changes between after v1.21.0. `spack-install` module replaced by
> `spack-setup` and `spack-execute` modules.
> [Details Below](#deprecations-and-breaking-changes)

## Examples

### `use` `spack-setup` with `spack-execute`

This will prepend the `spack-setup` script to the `spack-execute` commands.

```yaml
  - id: spack-setup
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-setup

  - id: spack-build
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-execute
    use: [spack-setup]
    settings:
      commands: |
        spack install gcc@10.3.0 target=x86_64

  - id: builder
    source: modules/compute/vm-instance
    use: [network1, spack-build]
```

### `use` `spack-setup` with `vm-instance` or Slurm module

This will run `spack-setup` scripts on the downstream compute resource.

```yaml
  - id: spack-setup
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-setup

  - id: spack-installer
    source: modules/compute/vm-instance
    use: [network1, spack-setup]
```

OR

```yaml
  - id: spack-setup
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-setup

  - id: slurm_controller
    source: community/modules/scheduler/schedmd-slurm-gcp-v6-controller
    use: [network1, partition1, spack-setup]
```

### Build `starup-script` with `spack-runner` output

This will use the generated `spack-setup` script as one step in `startup-script`.

```yaml
  - id: spack-setup
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-setup

  - id: startup-script
    source: modules/scripts/startup-script
    settings:
      runners:
      - $(spack-setup.spack-runner)
      - type: shell
        destination: "my-script.sh"
        content: echo 'hello world'

  - id: workstation
    source: modules/compute/vm-instance
    use: [network1, startup-script]
```

To see a full example of this module in use, see the [hpc-slurm-gromacs.yaml] example.

## Environment Setup

### Activating Spack

[Spack installation] produces a setup script that adds `spack` to your `PATH` as
well as some other command-line integration tools. This script can be found at
`<install path>/share/spack/setup-env.sh`. This script will be automatically
added to bash startup by any machine that runs the `spack_runner`.

If you have multiple machines that all want to use the same shared Spack
installation you can just have both machines run the `spack_runner`.

### Managing Spack Python dependencies

Spack is configured with [SPACK_PYTHON] to ensure that Spack itself uses a
Python virtual environment with a supported copy of Python with the package
`google-cloud-storage` pre-installed. This enables Spack to use mirrors and
[build caches][builds] on Google Cloud Storage. It does not configure Python
packages *inside* Spack virtual environments. If you need to add more Python
dependencies for Spack itself, use the `spack python` command:

```shell
sudo -i spack python -m pip install package-name
```

[SPACK_PYTHON]: https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#shell-support
[builds]: https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/binary_caches.html

## Spack Permissions

### System `spack` user is created - Default

By default this module will create a `spack` linux user and group with
consistent UID and GID. This user and group will own the Spack installation. To
allow a user to manually add Spack packages to the system Spack installation,
you can add the user to the spack group:

```sh
sudo usermod -a -G spack <username>
```

Log out and back in so the group change will take effect, then `<username>` will
be able to call `spack install <package>`.

> [!NOTE]
> A background persistent SSH connections may prevent the group change from
> taking effect.

You can use the `system_user_name`, `system_user_uid`, and `system_user_gid` to
customize the name and ids of the system user. While unlikely, it is possible
that the default `system_user_uid` or `system_user_gid` could conflict with
existing UIDs.

### Use and existing user

Alternatively, if `system_user_name` is a user already on the system, then this
existing user will be used for Spack installation.

#### OS Login User

If OS Login is enabled (default for most Cluster Toolkit modules) then you can
provide an OS Login user name:

```yaml
  - id: spack-setup
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-setup
    settings:
      system_user_name: username_company_com
```

This will work even if the user has not yet logged onto the machine. When the
specified user does log on to the machine they will be able to call
`spack install` without any further configuration.

#### Pre-configured user

You can also use a startup script to configure a user:

```yaml
  - id: spack-setup
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-setup
    settings:
      system_user_name: special-user

  - id: startup
    source: modules/scripts/startup-script
    settings:
      runners:
        - type: shell
          destination: "create_user.sh"
          content: |
            #!/bin/bash
            sudo useradd -u 799 special-user
            sudo groupadd -g 922 org-group
            sudo usermod -g org-group special-user
        - $(spack-setup.spack_runner)

  - id: spack-vms
    source: modules/compute/vm-instance
    use: [network1, startup]
    settings:
      name_prefix: spack-vm
      machine_type: n2d-standard-2
      instance_count: 5
```

### Chaining spack installations

If there is a need to have a non-root user to install spack packages it is
recommended to create a separate installation for that user and chain Spack installations
([Spack docs](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chain.html#chaining-spack-installations)).

Steps to chain Spack installations:

1. Get the version of the system Spack:

    ```sh
    $ spack --version

    0.20.0 (e493ab31c6f81a9e415a4b0e0e2263374c61e758)
    #       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    # Note commit hash and use in next step
    ```

1. Clone a new spack installation:

    ```sh
    git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true https://github.com/spack/spack.git <new_location>/spack
    git -C <new_location>/spack checkout <commit_hash>
    ```

1. Point the new Spack installation to the system Spack installation. Create a
   file at `<new_location>/spack/etc/spack/upstreams.yaml` with the following
   contents:

    ```yaml
    upstreams:
      spack-instance-1:
        install_tree: /sw/spack/opt/spack/
    ```

1. Add the following line to your `.bashrc` to make sure the new `spack` is in
   your `PATH`.

   ```sh
   . <new_location>/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
   ```

## Deprecations and Breaking Changes

The old `spack-install` module has been replaced by the `spack-setup` and
`spack-execute` modules. Generally this change strives to allow for a more
flexible definition of a Spack build by using native Spack commands.

For every deprecated variable from `spack-install` there is documentation on how
to perform the equivalent action using `commands` and `data_files`. The
documentation can be found on the [inputs table](#inputs) below.

Below is a simple example of the same functionality shown before and after the
breaking changes.

```yaml
  # Before
  - id: spack-install
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-install
    settings:
      install_dir: /sw/spack
      compilers:
      - gcc@10.3.0 target=x86_64
      packages:
      - intel-mpi@2018.4.274%gcc@10.3.0

- id: spack-startup
    source: modules/scripts/startup-script
    settings:
      runners:
      - $(spack.install_spack_deps_runner)
      - $(spack.install_spack_runner)
```

```yaml
  # After
  - id: spack-setup
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-setup
    settings:
      install_dir: /sw/spack

  - id: spack-execute
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-execute
    use: [spack-setup]
    settings:
      commands: |
        spack install gcc@10.3.0 target=x86_64
        spack load gcc@10.3.0 target=x86_64
        spack compiler find --scope site
        spack install intel-mpi@2018.4.274%gcc@10.3.0

- id: spack-startup
    source: modules/scripts/startup-script
    settings:
      runners:
      - $(spack-execute.spack-runner)
```

Although the old `spack-install` module will no longer be maintained, it is
still possible to use the old module in a blueprint by referencing an old
version from GitHub. Note the source line in the following example.

```yaml
  - id: spack-install
    source: github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/hpc-toolkit//community/modules/scripts/spack-install?ref=v1.22.1&depth=1
```
