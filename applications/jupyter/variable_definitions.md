### namespace

The namespace that Jupyterhub and rest of the other resources will be installed/allocated in. If using Jupyterhub with the Ray module (`ai-on-gke/ray-on-gke/`), it is recommanded to have this namespace the same as the one with Ray.

### create_namespace

Flag that if enabled, will create a namespace for the user using the [namespace](#namespace) field.

### add_auth

Flag that will enable IAP on Jupyterhub. Resources that will be created along with enable IAP:
    1. Global IP Address (If none is provided)
    2. Backend Config. Deployment that triggers enabling IAP.
    3. Managed Certificate. Deployment that creates a Google Managed object for SSL certificates
    4. Ingress. Deployment that creates an Ingress object that will connect to the Jupyterhub Proxy

### project_id

Name of the project where the cluster lives. Used to retrieve the project number as well as used in numerous resources.

### location

Location of the GKE cluster. Used by the terraform provider.

### service_name

Name of the Backend Service that gets created when enabling IAP.

### enable_iap_service

Flag that will enable the IAP Service API for the user on the project. If it is already enabled, leave it as false.

### brand

Name of the brand used for creating IAP OAuth clients. Currently only one is allowed per project. If there is already a brand, leave it empty.
Uses [support_email](#support_email)

### support_email

Support email assocated with the [brand](#brand). Used as a point of contact for consent for the ["OAuth Consent" in Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). It will not be used if brand is empty.

### url_domain_addr

Provided by the user if they want to bring their own URL/Domain. Used by the IAP resources if filled in. Filling this in will disable automatic global IP reservation. Must also fill in [url_domain_name](#url_domain_name).

### url_domain_name

This variable will only be used if [url_domain_addr](#url_domain_addr) is provided. It is the name associated with the domain provided by the user. Since we are using Ingress, it will require the `kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name` annotation along with the name associated.

### client_id

Client ID of an OAuth client created by the user for enabling IAP. When this variable is not empty, the template will not create an OAuth client for you. You must also input the [client_secret](#client_secret).

### client_secret

Client Secret associated with the [client ID](#client_id). This variable will only be used when the client id is filled out.
