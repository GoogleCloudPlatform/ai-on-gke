# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Coding style and formatting

### Terraform

We follow the guidelines and recommendations in the [Google Cloud Best practices for using Terraform](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/best-practices-for-terraform) document, unless noted otherwise.

The repository requires that files use built-in formatting using the `terraform fmt` command.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).
