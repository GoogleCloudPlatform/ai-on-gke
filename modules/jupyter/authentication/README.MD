## Creating Image

We currently already have a public image containing the authenticator class already configured for Jupyterhub so user's dont need to create their own, but if needed, these are the instructions to do so.

We combine the Jupyterhub image and our own authenticator. By default, the JupyterHub images already have pre-installed authenticator classes such as GitHub, Auth0, and Globus. In order to specify our own class for JupyterHub, our authentication class must also live in the JupyterHub image.

> **_NOTE:_** An Artifact Registry Repo for this docker image is required. Create an AR Repo following [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/create-repos)

1. Setup gcloud to point to your project.

2. Navigate to the `docker_image` directory. `cd docker_image`

3. Edit the `cloudbuild.yaml` file and replace the repository with your own repository.

4. Run `gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml .` to upload it to your repository.

5. Change the hub image name and tag in the [Jupyterhub config yaml](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/blob/main/jupyter-on-gke/jupyter_config/config-selfauth.yaml#L13).

## Configuration

To use the image once the it's uploaded to GCR/AR, edit the jupyterhub values `config.yaml` to use the image. Ex:

```yaml
hub:
  image: 
    name: gcr.io/aaronliang-agones-gke-dev/k8s-hub
    tag: latest
```

And set the authenticator class within the same file. Ex:

```yaml
...
    config: 
    JupyterHub:
      authenticator_class: 'gcpiapjwtauthenticator.GCPIAPAuthenticator'
...
```

This will tell Jupyterhub to use the specified authenticator class.

Pass the required fields needed by 'gcpiapjwtauthenticator.GCPIAPAuthenticator'. Ex:

```yaml
...
    GCPIAPAuthenticator: 
      header_name: 'X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion'
      # This config option should match the aud field of the JSONWebToken. Required. 
      expected_audience: '/projects/1085966111635/global/backendServices/8415836356342891701'
...
```

Fortuantely, few of these steps are already done for you if you follow the Jupyter-on-gke instructions.

## IAPUserLoginHandler and GCPIAPAuthenticator class

There are two classes within `gcpiapjwtauthenticator.py`, IAPUserLoginHandler and GCPIAPAuthenticator.
IAPUserLoginHandler is the python class that only has the JWT handler. It is used by the GCPIAPAuthenticator and therefore by Jupyterhub.
GCPIAPAuthenticator contains the `get_handler()` method that Jupyterhub requires for a custom authenticator. When Jupyterhub uses the GCPIAPAuthenticator by calling `get_handler()`, it will receieve the `IAPUserLoginHandler.get()` handler method.

## Terraform Variables and Resources

There are a few variables required when enabling IAP Authentication:

* [`add_auth`](#add_auth)
* [`enable_iap_service`](#enable_iap_service)
* [`brand`](#brand-and-support_email)
* [`support_email`](#brand-and-support_email)

### `add_auth`

The `add_auth` variable enables IAP on the cluster and will trigger the creation of the following resources:

* [Reserved IP address](#reserved-ip-address)
* [Backend Config](#backend-config)
* [Managed Certificate](#managed-certificate)
* [Ingress](#ingress)
* [Kubernetes Secret](#kubernetes-secret)

#### Reserved IP address

Reserves a Global IP Address for IAP. Used in the Ingress and the domain associated with the IP is used in the managed certificate

#### Backend Config

This deployment associates the IAP with the K8s secret and acts as the trigger that will enable the IAP service on the application.
[Link to deployment](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/blob/main/jupyter-on-gke/iap_module/deployments/backend-config.yaml)

#### Managed Certificate

Google managed SSL certificate. Associates the IAP service with a doamin.
[Link to deployment](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/blob/main/jupyter-on-gke/iap_module/deployments/managed-cert.yaml)

#### Ingress

Ingress for the Jupyterhub proxy-public application. Has the annotations:

- kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name
- networking.gke.io/managed-certificates

Both of which associates to the other deployments/resources created
[Link to deployment](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/blob/main/jupyter-on-gke/iap_module/deployments/static-ingress.yaml)

#### Kubernetes Secret

Contains the OAuth Client information used by the Backend Config.

### `enable_iap_service`

By default, the IAP service is not enabled on the project. If this variable is set to `true` it will enable the IAP Service on the project

### `brand` and `support_email`

To create an OAuth client, a brand is required. The brand is essentially the app show on the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). Ex:

![IAP Screen](../images/brand_screenshot.png)

The `support_email` variable will not be used if the `brand` variable is not filled in and is left empty. It is a required field for creating a `brand` and acts as a point of contact for users to contact with questions about consent.

## Allowlist for IAP

There are 2 ways to add users to the IAP allowlist so users can access Jupyterhub.

1. Manually on the Cloud Console
2. Add users to the allowlist file

### Manually

Navigate to [IAP](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/iap) and select the Backend Service associated with Jupyterhub.

Click on `Add Principal`. Add the email of the user/group and select the `IAP-secured Web App User` role to give access to that user/group

![IAP Screen](../images/IAP_screenshot.png)

### With Allowlist file

We use terraform to automatically add principals to IAP. By filling out the `allowlist` file [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/blob/main/jupyter-on-gke/allowlist), terraform will give the principals the appropriate roles to access Jupyterhub. The file must follow the format of 1 principal per line.

Example:

```unset
user:exampleuser@google.com
user:exampleuser2@google.com
serviceAccount:serviceaccount-compute@gserviceaccount.com
group:jupyter-group@google.com
serviceAccount:serviceaccount1234-compute@gserviceaccount.com
```
