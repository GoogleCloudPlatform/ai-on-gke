description: Official Helm chart for the Kubernetes DRA driver for NVIDIA GPUs

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)

# Note(JP): no v prefix allowed
version: 25.3.0-rc.1

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.

# Note(jgehrcke): templating logic consumes `appVersion` for building the default
# `tag` value used in a k8s image specification. That logic expects the version
# number below to not have a "v" prefix (a "v" is added by said logic to yield a
# valid image reference).
appVersion: "25.3.0-rc.1"
